## General

- Long-term
    - asynchronous storage
    - LDP
    - community standards
        - part of reason for this is to use supported standard packages for certain services, so as to enable fedora-specific development focus on more repo-specific services
    - shrinking codebase -- related to above focus on repo-specifc code

- Short-term
    - finalized first round of upgration pilots by end of may

- Audit service
    - community-developed

- PCDM
    - collections/objects/files
    - interoperability

- Columbia's one of the upgrade pilots

- tools (on github)
    - migration-utils( generic + islandora)
    - fedora-migrate (Hydra)

## My questions

- is the fuseki triple store an inherent part of fedora4? Or an add-on providing capability if desired.
    - same w/apache camel

- For Ben: at Brown, what would be involved in creating a provisioning-ish script to export x random objects (say, 100 to 1000) (along with internally associated objects) to a fully running fedora3 instance mirroring ours.

- When running either of the migration scripts, do they try to duplicate existing models directly? Or are the new models some version of the Portland Common Data Model?
